This is a 3D scene of a rustic table and a few props I made for a digital card game I was working on with a few friends in 2020. The table was meant to serve as the tabletop for the game. I was free to use whatever style I had in mind, so I went for a mix between stylized and PBR. 

Everything but the ground material was made in Blender and Substance Painter. The scene and render were made on Unity Engine. The floor was downloaded from [3dtextures.me](https://3dtextures.me/).

Below are some screenshots taken on Unity Engine.
