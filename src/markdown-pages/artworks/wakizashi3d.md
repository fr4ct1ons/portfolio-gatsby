This is a wakizashi I made in early 2020 mainly because I wanted to learn how to use Substance Painter. It's my first contact with textures in 3D art. I aimed for a PBR look of a weathered sword that has seen better days. While I think this was more or less achieved on the blade, looking back, I don't think the rest of the sword looks that good.
