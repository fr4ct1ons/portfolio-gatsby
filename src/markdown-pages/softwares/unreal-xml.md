This is still an ongoing personal project of mine, but I would really like to share the work-in-progress with this recording of an XML based dialogue system. I used Unreal's implementation of FastXML to create a dialogue system that could be easily expanded for my project, such as for triggering in-game events and changing characters' facial expressions. Below is a video of the system in action.

If you'd like, here's a closeup.
