The Unity Cel-Shaded Render Pipeline was a project I was working on during early 2020. I wanted to get a cel-shaded working on Unity but I didn't want to use the built-in render pipeline as it was going to be deprecated. However, the Universal and HD render pipelines didn't have the features I needed or were too overkill for what I wanted at the time, so I followed Catlike Coding's tutorials and created my own render pipeline with cel-shading in mind. A naive decision of mine at the time, but I did learn a lot about rendering with this project.

The code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/lucena-fr4ct1ons/unity-csrp) and you can read more about the project at [Itch.io](https://fr4ct1ons.itch.io/csrp).

Below is a reel I made at the time.
