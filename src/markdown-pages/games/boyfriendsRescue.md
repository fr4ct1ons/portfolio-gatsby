Boyfriend's Rescue is a 2D platformer game about saving your boyfriend from another dimension. It was made by Male Doll Studios, which I worked on an intership at during part of 2020. 

My responsibilities included programming two different player controllers, AIs for enemies on the third level of the game, such as smaller enemies, the mid-level boss and final boss as well as implementingÂ other props, bug fixes, localization system and some work on the UI, such as changing the UI whenever a the player uses a controller.

The game is a available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1280640/Boyfriends_Rescue___Gay_Platform_Game/) and [Itch.io](https://maledollstudio.itch.io/boyfriends-rescue).
