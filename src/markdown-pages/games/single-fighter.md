Sinle Fighter was a game I worked on all by myself during part of 2019 and early 2020. I made this game during GMTK Game Jam 2019, which the theme was "Only one". I made this because, among other things, I wanted to learn the animation and rigging tools on Blender and fighting games rely heavily on animations. At the time I was really into Super Smash Bros. for 3DS.

The game can be found on [Itch.io](https://fr4ct1ons.itch.io/single-fighter).
