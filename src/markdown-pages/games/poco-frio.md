Poço Frio is a third-person shooter I made with my friends during Natal Game Jam 2019, a game jam hosted by the local town hall. My team won third place with this entry.

I worked mainly as a programmer, setting up player controllers, weapon scripts, animator machines and materials, as well as part of the game's menu. I also set up the game's post-processing.

The game can be played on [Gamejolt](https://gamejolt.com/games/pocofrio/454479).
