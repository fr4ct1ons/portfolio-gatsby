Riptide is a small prototype-game I made on Unreal for a Ludum Dare 47, which the theme was "Stuck in a loop". I wanted to make a game about a space ship stuck in a space current, in which you would need to move in a direction against the current's. I did not manage to finish the game on time, but I still liked the stars effect, so I decided to upload it anyway.

You can check out the prototype on [Itch.io](https://fr4ct1ons.itch.io/riptide).
