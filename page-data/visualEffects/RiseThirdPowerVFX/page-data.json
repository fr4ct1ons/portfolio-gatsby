It is available on multiple platforms and storefronts, such as Steam, PS4 and Switch. I helped with the creation of some visual effects for enemy attacks, like magic attacks and environmental effects, such as rain and birds flying through the screen. Below is a sample of some those effects.</p>\n<p>First is one that I really like, which is the spawn effect for an enemy boss. The enemy materializing was made with a shader that uses the time variable to check if a fragment is up enough to be rendered completely, render only the color of the materialization or even render nothing at all. A pre-made noise texture was used to make the materializing energy not a straight line. The rest of the elements were made with Unity's particle system.</p>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gtUev6-wlSg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>Next up is a poisonous attack for a generic enemy. Multiple particle systems were used for this effect. There were some poison drops that, once collided with the ground, would leave a burn mark on the ground and a bit of smoke.</p>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i9q5a5fQfKY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>Last but definitely not least is a rain effect I made for the overworld. It was also made with particle systems, like the previous VFXes. <strong>This one has a catch, though</strong> - I was \"told\" to make the rain transition smoothly from a simple light rain to a more detailed heavy rain. I wrote a set of scripts (a system, if you will) that would change particle systems on runtime when a blend value is modified, similar to a slider on a shader. Below is a video of this system in action.</p>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6GwtU4DKyBE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 01, 2021","slug":"/visualEffects/RiseThirdPowerVFX","title":"Rise of the Third Power - Visual Effects","subtitle":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/visualEffects/RiseThirdPowerVFX","gallery":"visualEffects"}},
