I worked on this game with a few friends of mine after we won third place on Natal Game Jam 2019, a game jam hosted by our city's town hall. In the game, you play as the natives and must defend your homes and villages from the colonisers using various units, such as warrios, healers and hunters.</p>\n<p>I worked mainly as a tech artist and 3D artist, working on 3D models such as trees and houses, as well as creating and animating some characters. I also created some visual effects and shaders, added post-processing and set up animator machines inside Unity. Below you can find some of my work. Some of it was taken from the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/baladeirastudio/\">team's Instagram account</a>.</p>\n<p>Below is a healing effect used by the healer.

Ambient lighting is also changed.</p>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpONxjb8g8o\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p>Finally, here are some of the character animations and a screenshot of some 3D models.
