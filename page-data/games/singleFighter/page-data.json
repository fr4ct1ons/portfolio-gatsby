I made this game during GMTK Game Jam 2019, which the theme was \"Only one\". I made this because, among other things, I wanted to learn the animation and rigging tools on Blender and fighting games rely heavily on animations. At the time I was really into Super Smash Bros. for 3DS.</p>\n<p>The game can be found on <a href=\"https://fr4ct1ons.itch.io/single-fighter\">Itch.io</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"August 23, 2019","slug":"/games/singleFighter","title":"Single Fighter - 3D Unity fighting game","subtitle":"Sole programmer"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/games/singleFighter","gallery":"games"}},
