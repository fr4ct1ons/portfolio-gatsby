I wanted to make a game about a space ship stuck in a space current, in which you would need to move in a direction against the current's. I did not manage to finish the game on time, but I still liked the stars effect, so I decided to upload it anyway.</p>\n<p>You can check out the prototype on <a href=\"https://fr4ct1ons.itch.io/riptide\">Itch.io</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 24, 2020","slug":"/games/riptide","title":"Riptide - Unreal space game prototype"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/games/riptide","gallery":"games"}},
