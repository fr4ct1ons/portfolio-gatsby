I wanted to get a cel-shaded working on Unity but I didn't want to use the built-in render pipeline as it was going to be deprecated. However, the Universal and HD render pipelines didn't have the features I needed or were too overkill for what I wanted at the time, so I followed Catlike Coding's tutorials and created my own render pipeline with cel-shading in mind. A naive decision of mine at the time, but I did learn a lot about rendering with this project.</p>\n<p>The code can be found on <a href=\"https://github.com/lucena-fr4ct1ons/unity-csrp\">GitHub</a> and you can read more about the project at <a href=\"https://fr4ct1ons.itch.io/csrp\">Itch.io</a>.</p>\n<p>Below is a reel I made at the time.</p>\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Slay4KCBuJ8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 24, 2020","slug":"/software/unityCSRP","title":"Unity Cel-Shaded Render Pipeline"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/software/unityCSRP","gallery":"software"}},
